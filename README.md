I was following along through Greg Lukosek's book on learning C# through unity development to get a start grasp on C# as well as increase my knowledge of Unity. I am have worked through the entire book, and plan to transition and repurposed the code andriod development as well. So realistically this project will be in several stages. I will also be updating it later with a stand-along verison of the game for download and play for fun. Just a quick little project done in a couple of days. Thanks for looking at my work.
